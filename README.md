# Two-Input-Two-Output-Control-Scheme
An effective and computationally less intensive method for the stabilization of a Two-Input Two-Output, TITO, system is presented. The Input-Output (IO) models of the TITO under study are each described by a discrete-time model with its parameters estimated once every sample time. The discrete-time models are used in conjunction with two proposed performance indices to yield control signals to improve the overall system performance. The ability of the proposed self-tuning control scheme to reject small and large disturbances, and to overcome strong couplings in Multi-Input Multi-Output, MIMO, systems are investigated and presented in this study. Simulation tests show that the proposed enhanced self-tuning control scheme is suitable for Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and MIMO systems.
